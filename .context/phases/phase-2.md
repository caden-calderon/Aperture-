# Phase 2: Context Engine

**Status**: PENDING
**Goal**: Core engine for block/session management, persistence, classification, and policy-safe context actions
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 complete
**Estimated Scope**: ~55k context

---

## Context from Phase 1

Phase 1 delivers:
- Proxy that intercepts and forwards API calls
- Request/response parsing into universal Block format
- Event bridge for real-time UI updates
- Provider auto-detection (Anthropic vs OpenAI)
- Pause/hold mode for request inspection

**Key imports:**
```rust
use crate::proxy::parser::{parse_anthropic, parse_openai, Block};
use crate::events::{EventDispatcher, ContextEvent};
```

**Integration point:** Phase 2 builds the engine that processes parsed blocks.

---

## Problem Statement

1. **No zone management** — Blocks parsed but not assigned to primacy/middle/recency
2. **No accurate token counting** — Need tiktoken integration per model
3. **No staleness tracking** — Can't identify old/unused blocks
4. **No sorting pipeline** — No automatic classification based on content/age
5. **No session management** — Can't track multiple concurrent sessions
6. **No edit tracking** — Users can modify blocks but no undo/history
7. **No dependency awareness** — Don't know which blocks reference others
8. **No budget alerts** — No warnings when approaching token limit
9. **No action policy layer** — No centralized guardrails/undo log for automated mutations

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Block Management System

Extend `src-tauri/src/engine/` (skeleton exists from Phase 0.5):
- `block.rs` already defines canonical Block struct with all fields + serde derives
- `types.rs` already defines Role, Zone, CompressionLevel, PinPosition enums
- Add in-memory block storage with efficient lookup (`store.rs`)
- CRUD operations for blocks
- Batch operations (select multiple, compress multiple)
- Block versioning (track edits)

### 2. Zone System

Implement the three-zone model:
- **Primacy** — System prompts, pinned critical content
- **Middle** — Default zone, conversation history
- **Recency** — Last N turns, latest tool outputs

Auto-assignment rules:
- System role → primacy
- Last 5 turns → recency
- Everything else → middle
- Manual pinning overrides auto-assignment

### 3. Token Counting

Accurate per-model token counting:
- Integrate tiktoken-rs for OpenAI models
- Handle Anthropic tokenization (claude-3 tokenizer)
- Cache token counts per block
- Update UI token displays in real-time

### 4. Staleness Scoring

Track block freshness:
```
staleness = (turns_since_created × token_cost) / relevance_boost
```

- `turns_since_created` — How old is this block
- `token_cost` — Higher cost = more pressure to remove
- `relevance_boost` — References from later blocks reduce staleness

### 5. Context Sorting Pipeline

Fast classification pipeline (millisecond-scale, deterministic):

**Pass 1 — Role-based (instant):**
- System prompts → primacy
- Last N turns → recency
- Everything else → middle

**Pass 2 — Content heuristics (fast):**
- Error/traceback → boost toward recency
- Old file reads → demote in middle
- Correction patterns ("actually", "wait") → flag preceding block

**Pass 3 — Budget-aware ranking:**
- Approaching limit → rank middle zone by staleness
- Flag worst offenders for compression/removal

### 6. Session Management

Track multiple concurrent sessions:
- Session ID per active tool connection
- Separate block stores per session
- Session metadata (provider, start time, token budget)
- Session switching in UI

### Storage Layer (SQLite)

Persistent storage for sessions, blocks, and metadata:
- **Location:** `~/.aperture/aperture.db`
- **Schema:** Sessions, blocks, checkpoints, settings tables
- **Why SQLite:**
  - Single file, easy backup
  - Full-text search (FTS5) for Phase 8
  - Structured queries (filter by date, session, block type)
  - Rust support via `rusqlite`
  - Can store embeddings efficiently (BLOB)

**Initial tables:**
- `sessions` — id, provider, start_time, token_budget, metadata
- `blocks` — id, session_id, role, content, tokens, zone, compression_level, timestamps
- `block_versions` — block_id, version, content, edited_at, edit_source

**Note:** In-memory store (`BlockStore`) is the hot path for current session. SQLite syncs in background for persistence and historical access.

### 7. Basic Block Versioning

Track edits to blocks (foundation for Phase 11's advanced versioning):
- Store edit history per block (last 5 versions)
- Simple undo for manual edits
- Track who/what made the change (user, auto-rule, hot-patch)

### 8. Basic Dependency Tracking

Deterministic dependency tracking (Phase 7 adds semantic deps):
- File reference chains (block reads file → later blocks reference that file)
- Conversation flow (user → assistant → tool chains)
- Simple orphan detection (block's referenced file was removed)

### 9. Basic Budget Alerts

Simple threshold warnings (Phase 9 adds advanced analytics):
- Alert at 80%, 90%, 95% budget utilization
- Visual indicator on token budget bar
- Optional toast notification

### 10. Policy + Action Log Foundation

Add a deterministic mutation layer used by later phases:
- Central policy checks before destructive actions (compress/archive/remove)
- Structured action log with actor/reason/inputs/results
- Undo/rollback hooks for reversible operations
- Event payloads for transparent UI history

## Notes

**Block type definition:** The universal `Block` struct is defined in `engine::block.rs` and re-exported by `proxy::parser` for convenience. There is one canonical Block type shared across the codebase.

**Versioning scope:** Phase 2 implements basic edit history (last 5 versions, simple undo). Phase 11 enhances this with adaptive learning analysis and correction pattern tracking.

**Dependency scope:** Phase 2 implements deterministic tracking (file refs, conversation chains). Phase 7 adds semantic dependencies detected by the cleaner model.
