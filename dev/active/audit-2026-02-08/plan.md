# Audit Plan - 2026-02-08

## Objective
Complete a full codebase audit using `.context/AUDIT_PROMPT.md`, produce scored findings with file/line references, and generate a concrete remediation plan.

## Phases
1. Gather required context docs and validate current phase/docs alignment.
2. Run project checks (`make check`, tests, lint/type/build signals).
3. Audit source code across frontend, backend, config, docs.
4. Score 10 audit areas and rank issues/strengths/blockers/quick wins.
5. Write final markdown report and concise summary.

## Current Status
- `1` complete
- `2` complete
- `3` complete
- `4` complete
- `5` complete

## Notes
Context approaching limit; findings checkpointed to `context.md` before compaction.
Final report written to `dev/active/audit-2026-02-08/report.md`.
